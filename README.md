# ETF_tracker
A personal project that tracks ETF prices

As a lot of people (incl. myself) are overwhelmed by the amount of the investing opportunities out there, I decided to make a simple notebook which will look at the data from Investment.com and sort out the high return ETFs in the past year in which I may want to invest. 

I do live in Germany so I limit the ETFs that I can get in Germany and also the ones offered by BlackRock and Amundi - otherwise the list might get too overwhelming. 

### Packages used:
